# Song Generation Language Model (nanoGPT)

## Overview

This project implements a character-level language model for generating songs. The model is trained on a dataset of Spotify songs obtained from Kaggle, using the nanoGPT architecture â€“ a lightweight version inspired by the main GPT model. The nanoGPT used in this project has 20 million parameters.
